        Mandy is a 2018 American action horror dark fantasy film directed by
        Panos Cosmatos, from a screenplay by Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn, and
        based on a story by Cosmatos. Starring Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough,
        Linus Roache, Ned Dennehy, Olwen Fouéré, Richard Brake, and Bill Duke,
        the film follows Red Miller (Cage), a lumberjack seeking vengeance
        against cult leader Jeremiah Sand (Roache), as well as his devout
        followers, for the murder of his girlfriend, Mandy Bloom (Riseborough).
        Mandy premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2018, and
        was theatrically released in the United States on September 14, 2018.
        The film was a box office failure, grossing $1.7 million against its $6
        million production budget. Despite this, it received critical acclaim,
        with particular praise for its visual style and originality, Cage's
        performance, Cosmatos' direction, and the action sequences. At the 45th
        Saturn Awards, the film won for Best Independent Film, while Cage was
        nominated for Best Actor. Benjamin Loeb was nominated for Best
        Cinematography at the 34th Independent Spirit Awards. Mandy was one of
        the last films to be scored by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, who died of
        drug-related complications seven months before the film's release, and
        the film is dedicated to his memory.[5]
